SL-ANIMALS-DVS Dataset information
----------------------------------

Contents:
  -59 recording files (.aedat)
  -59 tag files (.csv)

In this dataset 59 individuals were recorded separately, and each individual performed 19 signs in sequence. 
The tag files mark the event number boundaries for each of the 19 signs/classes. 
This way, we have in theory 59*19=1121 items on the dataset. 
The items are NOT separated though, all 19 signs for each individual are in the same recording!

The recording was conducted in 4 sessions at different locations under different lighting conditions: 
  Set S1 -> 10 recordings, natural light from side window, higher angle lens
	[files marked with suffix "_imse"]
  Set S2 -> 25 recordings, natural light from side window
	[files marked with suffix "_dc"]
  Set S3 -> 17 recordings, indoors with artificial lightning from a neon light source
	[files marked with suffix "_indoor"]
  Set S4 -> 7 recordings, indoors under a strong frontal sunlight
	[files marked with suffix "_sunlight"]

The file order is as follows:
	user00 to user17: Set S3
	user18 to user24: Set S4
	user25 to user34: Set S1 
	uset35 to user59: Set S2
PS: there is no file named "user04" for unknown reasons.
